"""

# Variables

word1 = "Coding "    # This variable holds the first word in the phrase.
word2 = "is "        # This variable holds the second word in the phrase.
word3 = "Cool"       # This variable holds the LAST word in the phrase.

# Printing out the statement

print(word1 + word2 + word3) # With all the variables combined, it displays the statement: "Coding is Cool"

'''

Comments:
It's pretty simple for a first exercise. With the help of string concatenation, we can
combine all the variables together to complete the phrase.
