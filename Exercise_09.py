By: Kelvin Bautista
CCL4

"""

# The function below contains a command that prints hello:

def hello():
    print("Hello")

# The function below is another one that represents the main one, meaning this handles all the main commands.

def main():
    hello() # This calls the hello() function which will print "Hello"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Comments:
Although this was simply just a fill in the blank exercise, it helped me
understand functions better.
