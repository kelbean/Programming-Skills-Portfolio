## ‚òÑÔ∏è Introduction





Hello there! I see that you have stumbled upon the wild lands of my programming portfolio. Don't worry, you are very much welcome here!



Let me start by introducing myself:

My name is Kelvin. I'm basically just your average college student trying to survive in life. I decided to take the Creative Computing program because well.. as a young zoomer born in the early 2000s, I was already surrounded by a lot of technology so it's no surprise that I got exposed to computers and all that. Now, since I've always used computers growing up, I thought that I might as well learn the complexities of what goes on behind my computer screen. Although it might get difficult from time to time, at least I can enjoy it. Besides that, computer-related jobs like IT and software engineering are in high demand all over the globe so I had to take the opportunity.


Anyways, with that said, that'll be enough introduction from me. Let's go over what's exactly in this bizarre repository of mine.
